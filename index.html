  <h1>Soba Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 23, 2025</p>
  <p>
    Thank you for using Soba. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. If you have questions, contact us at 
    <a href="mailto:sobarelationshipapp@gmail.com">sobarelationshipapp@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This policy applies to the Soba mobile application (the “App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described here.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We use Sign in with Apple to create your account.</li>
    <li>We collect minimal information needed to operate Soba: your Apple user identifier, optional email and name provided by Apple on first sign-in, your chosen petname, and couple matching status.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your data. We do not use third‑party advertising.</li>
    <li>You can unmatch, sign out, or request account deletion at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following categories of information when you use Soba:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Account and Identity</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple user identifier (a unique identifier provided by Apple Sign in).</li>
        <li>Apple email address and full name, when Apple provides them on first sign‑in (may be private relay or not provided depending on your settings). If Apple does not provide these, we don’t collect them.</li>
        <li>Apple identity token used to verify your sign‑in. This token may be stored securely on your device and used to maintain your session.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Profile and Relationship</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Your chosen “petname.”</li>
        <li>Couple matching status, including whether you are matched and (if matched) your partner’s petname.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device and App Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic diagnostics and standard server logs (e.g., request timestamps, IP address) necessary to operate our service and ensure security.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We do not intentionally collect precise location, contacts, photos, or other device content.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and maintain your account via Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li>Let you choose and store a petname.</li>
    <li>Enable matching with a partner and show basic relationship context (e.g., partner’s petname).</li>
    <li>Authenticate requests and secure the service.</li>
    <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    <li>We do not share your data with third‑party advertisers.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with service providers that help us operate Soba (e.g., backend hosting, edge functions, and storage). These providers are bound by contractual obligations to protect your information and use it only to provide services to us.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account identifiers (e.g., Apple user identifier) are retained while your account is active.</li>
    <li>Petname and couple matching data are retained while you use the App and are deleted or anonymized upon account deletion or as otherwise required by law.</li>
    <li>Identity tokens are used for authentication and are stored securely on your device. On sign‑out, local tokens are removed. Server‑side session records are retained only as necessary for security and operations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unmatch:</strong> You can unmatch from your partner in the App. This clears couple data and returns you to the matching flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign Out:</strong> You can sign out at any time, which clears local data from your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> You can request a copy of your data, ask us to correct it, or delete your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:sobarelationshipapp@gmail.com">sobarelationshipapp@gmail.com</a>. We will verify your request and respond as required by applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information, including secure communication, limited access, and best practices for credential handling. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Soba is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>International Users</h2>
  <p>
    Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection laws than your country.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
